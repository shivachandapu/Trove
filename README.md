#  **Trove: A Decentralized File Storage System**

The demand for secure and efficient cloud storage solutions has surged in recent years, driven by the exponential growth of digital data and the need for reliable storage options. In response to these challenges, this project introduces ”Trove,” a decentralized file storage system that leverages blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to provide a secure, scalable, and resilient cloud storage solution. Trove aims to address the limitations of centralized storage systems by distributing data across a network of nodes, ensuring data integrity, availability, and privacy. One of the key features of Trove is its mechanism for storage providers, where users can offer their unused storage space to the network, thereby contributing to the overall storage capacity. Through a user-friendly interface and robust authentication mechanisms, Trove offers a seamless experience for both regular users and storage providers.
